As a minimum, I'd make sure to include the following:

# App Description

This app allows users to browse news articles, give up or down votes to the articles, post comments on the articles and read other user's comments.
The articles can be filtered by topic, sorted by Date, Number of comments or Number of votes.
The user will receive feedback from styling or messages, based on their interaction with the app, and on the status of the api calls made by their interactions.

## Usernames available for Login:

Once logged in as a user, the user can delete comments that were posted as that user.
